Sticky Tree: A plugin for XYplorer
Makes the tree panel follow the active pane -- an alternative to dual trees.


INSTALL

This is a combination of an external script written in AutoIt3, and a launcher script written in XYscript.

    * download the attached stickytree.zip. the archive contains:

        stickytree.exe: the stickytree executable
        stickytree.au3: The source autoit3 script
        stickytree.xys: the xyscript loader
        stickytree.ico: an icon that can be used in a ctb.

    * extract the archive contents to <xyscripts>\stickytree\.
    * make sure Dual Pane view is enabled.
    * that's it, all set! now you can just execute the XYScript to start sticky tree.
    * rerun the xyscript or disable Dual Pane view to stop.

    
INSTALL CTB

    * the XYScript is fully perpared to be used as a ctb. Just set the following command
      as both left- and right-click scripts of a ctb:
        ::load "<xyscripts>\stickytree\stickytree.xys",,'f'; // adjust path if necessary.
    * and done! the script will take care of ctb icon and caption as well.
    * left-click will toggle sticky tree. Right-click will show a config menu.


NOTES

    * The preferred independent method of stopping is to run this command in XY:
        ::copydata $P_STICKYTREE_HWND, "QUIT", 0;
      The script also quits when XY quits, and, depending on config, when DP is disabled.
    * the permavar $P_STICKYTREE_EXEC can define the command for running the executable script.
      this allows for running the source au3 script with the autoit interpreter.
      AutoIt3 version must be >= v3.3.15.1.
        ::perm $P_STICKYTREE_EXEC = 'path\to\autoit\beta\autoit.exe path\to\stickytree.au3';
    * the perm variable $P_STICKYTREE_PATH can control the path to the exe and the ini config.
      (In fact, if the files are in a non-default location, this permavar should be defined for
      the ctb config to find the correct ini file.)
    * both permavars can contain single-quoted variable path for portable path-keeping. Eg,
        ::perm $P_STICKYTREE_PATH = '<xyscripts>\_ext\stickytree';
        ::perm $P_STICKYTREE_EXEC = '<xypath>\..\au3beta\autoit3.exe $P_STICKYTREE_PATH\stickytree.au3';
    * if the script doesn't start, run this to unset two session permavars and retry:
        ::unset $P_STICKYTREE_TOGGLE, $P_STICKYTREE_HWND;
